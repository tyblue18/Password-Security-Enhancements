WEAK PASSWORD PATTERNS AND EXAMPLES

=== KEYBOARD PATTERNS (VERY WEAK) ===
These passwords follow predictable keyboard layouts and are extremely easy to guess:

qwerty - Standard QWERTY keyboard top row
asdf - Left side of QWERTY keyboard
zxcvbn - Bottom row of QWERTY keyboard  
qwertyuiop - Full top row of keyboard
asdfghjkl - Full middle row of keyboard
zxcvbnm - Full bottom row of keyboard
1234567890 - Number row sequence

WHY KEYBOARD PATTERNS ARE WEAK:
- Predictable and easy to guess
- Among first passwords tried by hackers
- No real randomness or complexity
- Part of standard dictionary attacks
- Commonly found in breach databases

=== SEQUENTIAL PATTERNS (VERY WEAK) ===
123456 - Sequential numbers
12345678 - Longer sequential numbers  
123456789 - Even longer sequential numbers
abcdef - Sequential letters
abc123 - Letters followed by numbers
password123 - Dictionary word + sequential numbers

WHY SEQUENTIAL PATTERNS ARE WEAK:
- Extremely predictable
- First attempts in brute force attacks
- No randomness or entropy
- Easy for humans and computers to guess

=== DICTIONARY WORDS (WEAK) ===
password - Most common weak password
letmein - Common phrase
welcome - Common greeting
admin - System administrator default
login - Login-related word
master - Authority-related word

WHY DICTIONARY WORDS ARE WEAK:
- Found in password cracking dictionaries
- Easy to guess with dictionary attacks
- No complexity or randomness
- Often first passwords people try

=== COMMON SUBSTITUTIONS (WEAK) ===
passw0rd - 'o' replaced with '0'
p@ssword - 'a' replaced with '@'
1234567! - Numbers with single special character

WHY SIMPLE SUBSTITUTIONS ARE WEAK:
- Predictable character replacements
- Easily detected by password crackers
- Minimal increase in actual security
- Common patterns in leaked databases

=== PERSONAL INFORMATION PATTERNS (WEAK) ===
name123 - Name followed by numbers
birthday dates (1990, 2000, etc.)
sports teams (football, soccer)
family names + years

WHY PERSONAL INFORMATION IS WEAK:
- Easy to research on social media
- Predictable to people who know you
- Often reused across multiple accounts
- Vulnerable to targeted attacks

=== STRENGTH ASSESSMENT ===
If a password appears in this list or follows these patterns, it should be considered:
- VERY WEAK: Will be cracked in seconds/minutes
- HIGH RISK: Likely to be in breach databases
- UNSUITABLE: Should never be used for any account
- IMMEDIATE CHANGE: Replace immediately with strong password

RECOMMENDATION: Use long, random passphrases or password manager generated passwords instead.
