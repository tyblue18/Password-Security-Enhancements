DINOSAURS 
Dinosaurs, or behemoths, are among the oldest reptiles 
in the world. Predatory dinosaurs are savage, territorial 
hunters. Herbivorous dinosaurs are less aggressive, but 
they might attack to defend their young, or if startled 
or harassed. 
Dinosaurs come in many sizes and shapes. Larger 
varieties often have drab coloration, while smaller 
dinosaurs have colorful markings akin to birds. 
Dinosaurs roam rugged and isolated areas that 
humanoids seldom visit, including remote mountain 
valleys, inaccessible plateaus, tropical islands, 
and deep fens. 
ALLOSAURUS 
The allosaurus is a predator possessing great size, 
strength, and speed. It can run down almost any prey 
over open ground, pouncing to pull creatures down with 
its wicked claws. 
ANKYLOSAURUS 
Thick armor plating covers the body of the plant-eating 
ankylosaurus, which defends itself against predators 
with a knobbed tail that delivers a devastating strike. 
Some varieties of ankylosaurus have spiked tails that 
deal piercing damage instead of bludgeoning damage. 
PLESIOSAURUS 
A plesiosaurus is a marine dinosaur whose compact 
body is driven by powerful flippers. Predatory and 
aggressive, it attacks any creature it encounters . Its 
flexible neck accounts for a third of its total length, 
letting it twist in any direction to deliver a powerful bite. 
PTERANODON 
These flying reptiles have wingspans of 15 to 20 feet 
and typically dive for small marine prey, though they 
are opportunists and will attack any creature that 
appears edible. A pteranodon has no teeth, instead 
using its sharp beak to stab prey too large to swallow 
with one gulp. 
TRICERATOPS 
One of the most aggressive of the herbivorous 
dinosaurs, a triceratops has a skull that flares out to 
form a protective plate of bone. With its great horns 
and formidable speed, a triceratops gores and tramples 
would-be predators to death. 
TYRANNOSAURUS REX 
This enormous predator terrorizes all other creatures in 
its territory. Despite its size and weight, a tyrannosaurus 
is a swift runner. It chases anything it thinks it can eat, 
and there are few creatures it won't try to devour whole. 
While prowling for substantial prey, a tyrannosaurus 
subsists on carrion, and on any smaller creatures that 
try to dart in to steal its meal. Large beast, unaligned

DISPLACER BEAST 
This monstrous predator takes its name from its 
ability to displace light so that it appears to be several 
feet away from its actual location. A dis placer beast 
resembles a sleek great cat covered in blue-black fur. 
However, its otherworldly origins are clear in its six 
legs and the two tentacles sprouting from its shoulders, 
both ending in pads tipped with spiky protrusions. A 
dis placer beast's eyes glow with an awful' malevolence 
that persists even in death. 
Unseelie Origins. Displacer beasts roamed the 
twilight lands of the Feywild for ages, until they were 
captured and trained by the Unseelie Court. The 
warriors of the court selectively bred the beasts to 
reinforce their ferocious and predatory nature, using 
them to hunt unicorns, pegasi, and other wondrous 
prey. However, it didn't take long for the displacer 
beasts to use their malevolent intelligence to escape 
their masters. 
Running and breeding freely in the Feywild, the 
displacer beasts soon came to the attention of the 
Seelie Court. With blink dog companions at their side, 
fey hunters drove these predators to the fringes of the 
Feywild, where many crossed over to the Material 
Plane. To this day, displacer beasts and blink dogs 
attack each other on sight. 
Love of the Kill. Dis placer beasts kill not just for 
food but also for sport. They target prey even when 
not hungry, often toying with their victims to entertain 
themselves until they are ready to eat. After killing 
its prey using its tentacles, a displacer beast drags 
the corpse to a quiet place where it can feed without 
distraction. 
Displacer beasts hunt alone or in small prides that 
demonstrate skill at setting ambushes. A single beast 
will strike and withdraw, luring prey into a densely 
wooded area where its packmates wait. Packs of 
displacer beasts hunting near trade roads recall the 
frequency and schedule of regular caravans, laying 
down ambushes to pick off those caravans. Large monstrosity, lawful evil

Avoidance. If the displacer beast is subjected to an effect that 
allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it 
instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, 
and only half damage if it fails. 
Displacement. The displacer beast projects a magical illusion 
that makes it appear to be standing near its actual location, 
causing attack rolls against it to have disadvantage. If it is hit 
by an attack, this trait is disrupted until the end of its next 
turn. This trait is also disrupted while the displacer beast is 
incapacitated or has a speed ofO. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The displacer beast makes two attacks with its 
tentacles. 
Tentacle. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10ft., one

Prized Guards and Pets. Intelligent evil creatures 
favor dis placer beasts as pets, but a dis placer beast 
enters such an alliance only if it appears beneficial. 
A displacer beast might guard a vault or act as a 
bodyguard for a prominent individual.

DOPPELGANGER 
Doppelgangers are devious shapeshifters that take 
on the appearance of other humanoids, throwing off 
pursuit or luring victims to their doom with misdirection 
an.d disguise. Few creatures spread fear, suspicion, and 
deceit better than doppelgangers . Found in every land 
and culture, they can take on the guise of any individual 
of any race. 
Stealing Secrets. A doppelganger's adopted form 
allows it to blend into almost any group or community, 
but its transformation doesn't impart languages, 
mannerisms, memory, or personality . Doppelgangers 
often follow or capture creatures they intend to 
impersonate, studying them and probing their minds for 
secrets. A doppelganger can read a creature's surface 
thoughts, allowing it to glean that creature's name, 
desires, and fears, along with a few scattered memories.

Shapechanger. The doppelganger can use its action to 
polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid it has seen, or 
back into its true form. Its statistics, other than its size, are the 
same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't 
transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies. 
Ambusher. The doppelganger has advantage on attack rolls 
against any creature it has surprised. 
Surprise Attack. If the doppelganger surprises a creature and 
hits it with an attack during the first round of combat, the 
target takes an extra 10 (3d6) damage from the attack. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The doppelganger makes two melee attacks. 
Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage. 
Read Thoughts. The doppelganger magically reads the surface 
thoughts of one creature within 60 feet of it. The effect can 
penetrate barriers, but 3 feet of wood or dirt, 2 feet of stone, 
2 inches of metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks it. While the 
target is in range, the doppelganger can continue reading its 
thoughts, as long as the doppelganger's concentration isn't 
broken (as if concentrating on a spell). While reading the 
target's mind, the doppelganger has advantage on Wisdom 
(Insight) and Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, and 
Persuasion) checks against the target. 
part of a long-term plot might keep its double alive and 
close at hand for weeks, probing the victim's mind daily 
to learn how to behave and speak authentically. 
Hedonistic Swindlers. Doppelgangers work alone 
or in small groups, with group roles shifting from con 
to con. While one doppelgang er takes the place of a 
murdered merchant or noble, the others take on a 
number of identities as circumstances warrant, playing 
the parts of family or servants while they live off the 
victim's riches. 
Changelings. Doppelgangers are too lazy or self­
interested to raise their young. They assume attractive 
male forms and seduce women, leaving them to raise 
their progeny. A doppelganger child appears to be a 
normal member of its mother's species until it reaches 
adolescence, at which point it discovers its true nature 
and is driven to seek out its kind to join them. 
DRACOLICH 
Even as long-lived as they are, all dragons must 
eventually die. This thought doesn't sit well with 
many dragons, some of which allow themselves to 
be transformed by necromantic energy and ancient 
rituals into powerful undead dracoliches. Only the 
most narcissistic dragons choose this path, knowing 
that by doing so, they sever all ties to their kin and the 
dragon gods. 
Beyond Death. A dracolich retains its shape and 
size upon transforming, its skin and scales drawing 
tight to its bones or sloughing away to leave a skeletal 
form behind. Its eyes appear as glowing points of light 
floating in shadowy sockets, hinting at the malevolence 
of its undead mind. 
Though many dragons pursue vain goals of 
destruction and dominanc e, dracoliches are more 
nefarious than the most evil dragons, driven to rule 
over all. A dracolich is a fiendishly intelligent tyrant that 
crafts complex webs of foul schemes, attracting servants 
motivated by greed and a lust for power. Acting from 
the shadows and actively plotting to keep its existence a 
secret, a dracolich is a cunning and challenging foe. 
Draco/ich Phylacteries. Creating a dracolich requires 
the cooperation of the dragon and a group of mages or 
cultists that can perform the proper ritual. During the 
ritual, the dragon consumes a toxic brew that slays it 
instantly. The attendant spellcasters then ensnare its 
spirit and transfer it to a special gemstone that functions 
like a lich's phylactery. As the dragon's flesh rots 
away, the spirit inside the gem returns to animate the 
dragon's bones. 
If a dracolich 's physical form is ever destroyed, its 
spirit returns to the gem as long as the two are on 
the same plane. If the gem comes into contact with 
another dragon's corpse, the dracolich's spirit can take 
possession of that corpse to become a new dracolich. If 
the dracolich's spirit gem is taken to another plane, the 
dracolich's spirit has nowhere to go when its undead 
body is destroyed and simply passes into the afterlife. 
DRACOLICH TEMPLATE 
Only an ancient or adult true dragon can be transform ed 
into a dracolich. Younger dragons that attempt to 
undergo the transformation die, as do other creatures 
that aren't true dragons but possess the dragon type, 
such as pseudodragons and wyverns. A shadow dragon 
can't be transform ed into a dracolich, for it has already 
lost too much of its physical form. 
When a dragon becomes a dracolich, it retains its 
statistics except as described below. The dragon loses 
any trait, such as Amphibious, that assumes a living 
physiology. The dracolich might retain or lose any or all 
of its lair actions or inherit new ones, as the DM sees fit. 
Type. The dracolich's type changes from dragon 
to undead, and it no longer requires air, food, 
drink, or sleep. 
Damage Resistance. The dracolich has resistanc e to 
necrotic damage. Damage Immunities. The dracolich has immunity 
to poison. It also retains any immunities it had prior to 
becoming a dracolich. 
Condition Immunities. The dracolich can't be 
charmed, frightened, paralyzed, or poisoned. It also 
doesn't suffer from exhaustion. 
Magic Resistance. The dracolich has advantage on 
saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

DRAGON, SHADOW 
Shadow dragons are true dragons that were either born 
In the Shadowfell or transformed by years spent within 
its dismal confines. Some shadow dragons embrace 
the Shadowfell for its bleak landscapes and desolation. 
Others seek to return to the Material Plane, hungry to 
spread the darkness and evil of the Plane of Shadow. 
Dark Portals. Portals to the Shadowfell manifest 
in forlorn places and the deep gloom of subterranean 
caverns. The dragons that lair in such places often 
discover these portals and find themselves transported 
to a new realm. Ancient dragons that sleep in their lairs 
for months or years at a time might find themselves 
spirited away, never knowing that a portal has formed 
without their knowledg e as they dream. 
Recast in Shadow. The transformation to a shadow 
dragon happens over a period of years, during which 
time a dragon's scales lose their luster and fade to a 
charcoal hue. Its leathery wings become translucent, its 
eyes paling to pools of opalescent gray. Shadow dragons 
find ~unlight abhorrent, and they are weaker in bright 
light than they are in darkness. Darkness makes the 
dragon fade to a spectral shadow of its former self. 
The magical nature of dragons holds an attraction 
for the Shadowfell, which seems somehow to crave Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
/4it: 14 (2d6 + 7) slashing damage. 
Tail. Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. 
Hit: 16 (2d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage. 
Frightful Presence. Each creature of the dracolich's choice that 
is within 120 feet of the dracolich and aware of it must succeed 
on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 
minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of 
each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a 
creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, 
the creature is immune to the dracolich's Frightful Presence for 
the next 24 hours. 
Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6). The dracolich exhales 
lightning in a 90-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in 
that line must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 
66 (12d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much 
damage on a successful one. 
LEGENDARY ACTIONS 
The dracolich can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from 
the options below. Only one legendary action option can be 
used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. 
The dracolich regains spent legendary actions at the start 
of its turn. 
Detect. The dracolich makes a Wisdom (Perception) check. 
Tail Attack. The dracolich makes a tail attack. 
Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions). The dracolich beats its tattered 
wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dracolich must 
succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (2d6 
+ 7) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. After 
beating its wings this way, the dracolich can fly up to half its 
flying speed. 
the might and majesty of these great reptiles. The 
Shadowfell also has a dispiriting effect on its denizens, 
such that the longer a creature remains on the plane, 
the more it accepts the plane's malaise. As months and 
years pass for a dragon on the Shadowfell, it becomes 
aware of the transformation being wrought upon it, and 
yet can do nothing to prevent it. 
· Back in the World. A shadow dragon is so suffused 
with the power of the Shadowfell that even a return to 
the Material Plane can't undo its transformation. Some 
shadow dragons attempt to lure other creatures from 
the mortal realm back to the Shadowfell to keep them 
company, at least until they tire of their guests and 
devour them. Others are happy to leave the Shadowfell 
behind forever, understanding that treasure and power 
are easier to come by in the Material Plane. 
SHADOW DRAGON TEMPLATE 
Only a true dragon can transform into a shadow dragon, 
and only if it is born in the Shadowfell or remains there 
for several years. A dracolich can't be turned into a 
shadow dragon, since it loses its draconic nature when it 
becomes undead. 
When a dragon becomes a shadow dragon, it retains 
its statistics except as described below. The shadow 
dragon might retain or lose any or all of its lair actions 
or inherit new ones, as the DM sees fit. 
Damage Resistances. The dragon has resistance to 
necrotic damage. 
Skill Proficiency: Stealth. The dragon's proficiency 
bonus is doubled for its Dexterity (Stealth) checks. 
Living Shadow. While in dim light or darkness, 
the dragon has resistance to damage that isn't force, 
psychic, or radiant. 
Shadow Stealth. While in dim light or darkness, the 
dragon can take the Hide action as a bonus action. 
Sunlight Sensitivity. While in sunlight, the dragon 
has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom 
(Perception) checks that rely on sight. 
New Action: Bite. If the dragon deals acid, cold, fire, 
lightning, or poison damage with its bite, change that 
damage type to necrotic. 
New Action: Shadow Breath. Any damage-deali ng 
breath weapon possessed by the dragon deals 
necrotic damage instead of its original damage type. A 
humanoid reduced to 0 hit points by this damage dies, 
and an undead shadow rises from its corpse and acts 
immediately after the dragon in the initiative count. The 
shadow is under the dragon's control. YOUNG RED SHADOW DRAGON
